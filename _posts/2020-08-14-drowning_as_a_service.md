# Drowning as a Service (DASS)
As a young child I saw the movie "The Abyss." I don't remember what it's about, other than it involved a submarine, the ocean, and I think aliens.  

One thing I do remember is the special sciency oxygenated water that you can't drown it.  If someone tries drowning you in it, You might not like it at first.
You might panic. It might be more effort than just breathing regular air.  But you're going to be OK. 
And you get all the benefits that go with being able to breathe under water.

This lesson of just allowing yourself to get used to the pain for the greater good has stuck with me. I remember when someone first forced
tests on me. It was painful, but I got used to it pretty quickly and started enjoying its benefits. I think a lot of other good practices
are like this (code reviews, typing (in python), documentation.) 

# Conclusion
So, if someone places their hand on your head and tries to (or so it seems) drown you, don't immediately react. Take a deep breath (if possible) and ask yourself if
you really need to resist this. 

How could you be drowning yourself today?

Who could you be drowning?

## Note
Please don't use this as an excuse to force emacs on people.
