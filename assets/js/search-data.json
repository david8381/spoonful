As a young child I saw the movie “The Abyss.” I don’t remember what it’s about, other than it involved a submarine, the ocean, and I think aliens. . One thing I do remember is the special sciency oxygenated water that you can’t drown it. If someone tries drowning you in it, You might not like it at first. You might panic. It might be more effort than just breathing regular air. But you’re going to be OK. And you get all the benefits that go with being able to breathe under water. . Abyss Rat Drowning Clip . This lesson of just allowing yourself to get used to the pain for the greater good has stuck with me. I remember when someone first forced tests on me. It was painful, but I got used to it pretty quickly and started enjoying its benefits. I think a lot of other good practices are like this (code reviews, typing (in python), documentation.) . Conclusion . So, if someone places their hand on your head and tries to (or so it seems) drown you, don’t immediately react. Take a deep breath (if possible) and ask yourself if you really need to resist this. . How could you be drowning yourself today? . Who could you be drowning? . Caveats . Please don’t use this as an excuse to force emacs on people. Please do use this as an excuse to help them discover the benefits of vim. .",

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | .
